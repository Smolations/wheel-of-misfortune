Welcome to Wheel of Misfortune!

The project name may be a bit of a misnomer. If it has brought any feelings of anxiety, you can rest easy. Its origin comes from the fact that this app is [unfortunately] broken! It will be your job to fix it.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Assessing Skills

As a programmer, you are no doubt aware of all the varying skills assessments companies use during the interview process. To prepare for these assessments, there are myriad websites that offer various, one-off coding challenges. However, I believe these assessments are often fundamentally flawed. The biggest of these flaws is that the vast majority of candidates are applying for positions where an established code base already exists. You most likely don't need to solve a linked list problem, an array sorting problem, or any other, isolated programming task.

Enter the Wheel of Misfortune! You will be working on an app with existing code, standards, and practices. You will utilize skills that are _actually_ applicable to your day-to-day work. Some of these skills are:

- debugging errors
- architecture issues
- test writing/debugging
- fixing linting issues
- adding new features

I know firsthand how nerve-wracking these kinds of assessments are, so this project was created to make candidates feel more comfortable during the process and to focus on the skills you will need from day 1.

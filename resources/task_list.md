## Getting Started

First, check the `package.json` for the required version(s) of node, and be sure you are running a valid version. Next, clone this project on your machine and run `npm install`. You are now able to run the app with `npm start`. The page should open in your browser immediately, but if it doesn't, open `http://localhost:3000`.


## The server is running. Now what?

If you have the app open in your browser, you will probably notice that something isn't right. You'll need to begin by fixing things! You'll have some other tasks to do as well, and those tasks are listed a little farther below.


### What are my goals?

While there is a time limit for this assessment, it is **NOT** an expectation that you will finish every task. This is part of the assessment! When given tasks at your job, you often have to decide what's important and prioritize your work accordingly. Each programmer tackles tasks of varying complexity in different ways. I just kinda want to watch you work. :upside_down_smile:

Feel free to ask questions as you work. You may add any libraries you see fit, rename things, move files around, change implementation specs, etc. Think of this as an inherited project of which you now hold ownership. Find your rhythm and make this project your own.

And try to forget that this is an evaluation. :yum:


### Tasks/Requirements

Below are two lists of tasks/requirements. The first list is required (the product team feels really strongly about these!), and you will most likely tackle one or more of those items first. The second list is a "nice-to-have" list. You should have time to complete several of these, and you can work on them in any order you see fit. You don't have to complete _any_ task in any particular order, but the first list should be complete by the end of this session.


#### Required

[ ] The app should boot up so that an interactive UI is accessible (i.e. stuff renders)

#### Nice-to-haves
